# Java games

The following repository contains executable jars of games developped with Javafx.  
I developped those games in 2015 during my 2nd year of Bachelor degree. Some of them also include an AI, but they are all na√Øve and power consuming as I was a young padawan in IT at that time.  
In order to spare your eyes from how dirty the code was, I won't add it to the repo. I can give it if you want to tho.
